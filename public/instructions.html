<h2>How to</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upload a *.csv file. To get the csv file, export it from Excel by using "Save as...". The csv file should have
    the following structure:</li>
  <li>Provide a header row with the names of the services that the participants of your focus group came up with/could
    choose from. We recommend using short labels for the names of the services to make the service map as readable as possible.
  </li>
  <li>Provide one row for each participant. The name of the participant (can be anonymised but must be unique) must be
    in the first column, then insert the number of counters they assigned to each service. If participants could only
    select Yes or No, put in a 1 (Yes) or 0 (No).
  </li>
  <li>In rows at the bottom, provide your Decision Criteria that you want to assess each service with respect to. Examples
    are "Ease of delivery" or "Near-term economic benefit" (as defined in Clements et al 2019). For each service, insert a
    number to rate the service. When ranking services according to a Decision Criterion, larger numbers are interpreted as better.
  </li>
  <li>Optional: To control the colour of the service bubbles, add an additional row titled 'Colour' and indicate with numbers
    which services should be the same colour. For example, if you held multiple focus groups you can use the colour of each
    service bubble to indicate how many of the groups suggested that service.
  </li>
</ul>
